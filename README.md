Weather display functionality inspired by

I added a section for depture times of Busses, Tram and Subway (using BVG-grabber api).

Please note, that this was just an excercise for me, to introduce myself into Python and that my goal was not to write beautiful code, but rather something that works.

Anyhow, this code is only taylored to my own needs and needs quite a refactoring to enable free configuration by users.
